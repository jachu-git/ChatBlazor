Database Update Instructions

If you're experiencing issues with database migrations, follow these steps to reset and update your database:

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
   (Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console)

2. Ensure that the Default project in the Package Manager Console is set to your main project (usually the one containing your DbContext).

3. Run the following command to drop the existing database:
   Drop-Database

4. After the database has been dropped, run the following command to create a new database and apply all migrations:
   Update-Database

5. If you encounter any errors during this process, make sure all your migration files are present in the Migrations folder and that your DbContext is properly configured.

Note: This process will delete all data in your existing database. 

If you need to update to a specific migration, you can use:
Update-Database -Migration MigrationName

Replace 'MigrationName' with the name of the desired migration.
